export default `# Custom Samples
Zen fetches samples via HTTP requests, looking for additional, locally served files on localhost:5000. To serve your own samples, download and install this [simple package](https://github.com/cephasteom/ct-samples). Follow the instructions in the README.md and refresh Zen. Your custom samples should be listed in the console.
