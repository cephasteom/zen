export default `# The Editor
On the left of the user interface is the code editor and, below this, the console: for logging errors and getting information. On the right, you can toggle through different combinations of the pattern visualiser and the quantum circuit schematic, using the icons in the lower toolbar.

In the toolbar, there also are controls for play/stop, save and load.

Editor commands:
- \`shift+enter\` executes the code and starts playback
- \`esc\` stops playback.
- \`cmd+o\` opens a list of presets and saved files
- \`cmd+s\` saves your code
