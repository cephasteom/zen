export default `# The Editor
The best place to start is by using the <a href="https://zen.cephasteom.co.uk" target="_blank">online editor</a>. On the left, you should see a code editor and on the right, a console for communicating errors and debugging your code, a visualisation of the position of your streams, and a blank quantum circuit.

In the toolbar, there are controls for play/stop, save and load.

Editor commands:
- \`shift+enter\` executes the code and starts playback
- \`esc\` stops playback.
- \`cmd+o\` opens a list of presets and saved files
- \`cmd+s\` saves your code
