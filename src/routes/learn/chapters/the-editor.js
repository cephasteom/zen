export default `# The Editor
The best place to start is by using the <a href="https://zen.cephasteom.co.uk" target="_blank">online editor</a>. On the left, you should see a code editor and on the right, a console for communicating errors and debugging your code.

In the toolbar, there are controls for play/stop, save and load. The final icon toggles between the console and a pattern visualiser - which we recommend turning on whilst following this tutorial. The current time \`t\`, cycle \`c\`, number of divisions per cycle \`q\`, and the size of the visualiser canvas \`s\` are displayed beneath the console. More on these values later.

Editor commands:
- \`shift+enter\` executes the code and starts playback
- \`esc\` stops playback. Pressing esc twice resets \`t\`
- \`cmd+o\` opens a list of presets and saved files
- \`cmd+s\` saves your code
