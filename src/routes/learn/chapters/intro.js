Welcome to Zen! Here, you can generate complex musical patterns using a simple JavaScript API, and harness quantum computing algorithms to explore new approaches to sound design. Zen is a holistic, standalone environment, with a suite of high-quality instruments and effects - including synths, samplers, effects and filters. It can also be integrated into your existing studio through MIDI.

This is a tutorial to help you get started. For more information, check out the [docs](/docs).

Zen will work in most browsers but, for best performance, we recommend something Chromium-based.

Enjoy!
