Welcome to Zen, a tool for composing music in the browser. Here, you can generate complex musical patterns using a simple JavaScript API, and harness quantum computing algorithms to explore new approaches to sound design. It is an holistic environment, providing many high-quality instruments and effects - including synths, samplers, effects and filters - and can be integrated into your existing studio through MIDI.

This is a tutorial to help you get started. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it should give you a good idea of how to use Zen. For more information, check out the reference documentation. We recommend that you open the code editor in a separate tab so that you can see and hear the patterns in the examples that follow.

Zen will work in most browsers but, for best performance, we recommend something Chromium-based.

Enjoy!
