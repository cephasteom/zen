Welcome to Zen, a tool for composing music in the browser. Zen allows you to generate complex musical patterns using a simple JavaScript API. It comes with a number of high-quality instruments and effects - including synths, samplers, delay and reverb - as well as integrating with your existing studio through MIDI.

This is a tutorial to help you get started. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it should give you a good idea of how to use Zen. For more information, check out the reference documentation. We recommend that you open the code editor in a separate tab and turn on the pattern visualiser so that you can see and hear the patterns in the examples that follow.

Zen will work in most browsers but, for best performance, we recommend Google Chrome.

Enjoy!
