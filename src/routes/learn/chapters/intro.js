Welcome to Zen, a tool for composing music in the browser using quantum algorithms. In Zen, you can design quantum circuits, and generate complex musical patterns using a simple JavaScript API. It comes with a number of high-quality instruments and effects - including synths, samplers, delay and reverb - and can be integrated into your existing studio through MIDI.

This is a tutorial to help you get started. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it should give you a good idea of how to use ZenQ. For more information, check out the reference documentation. We recommend that you open the code editor in a separate tab so that you can see and hear the patterns in the examples that follow.

Zen will work in most browsers but, for best performance, we recommend Google Chrome.

Enjoy!
