Welcome to Zen! This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of Zen, Live Coding, or JavaScript. We'll start with some basic coding skills and work our way up to Zen's more advanced features. Along the way, you can test your skills with a range of coding challenges, and there are composition prompts and project ideas at the end to help you get started making music with Zen.
