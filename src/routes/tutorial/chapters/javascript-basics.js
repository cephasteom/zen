Welcome to the JavaScript Basics chapter of the Zen tutorial! In this chapter, we'll cover some fundamental concepts of JavaScript that are essential for using Zen effectively.

## Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare a variable using the \`let\`, \`const\`, or \`var\` keywords. For example:


\`\`\`javascript
let x = 10;
const y = 20;
var z = x + y;
\`\`\`

## Data Types
JavaScript has several data types, including:
- **Number**: Represents numeric values (e.g., \`42\`, \`3.14\`).
- **String**: Represents text (e.g., \`"Hello, World!"\`).
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values (\`true\` or \`false\`).
- **Array**: Represents a list of values (e.g., \`[1, 2, 3]\`).
- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs (e.g., \`{name: "Zen", type: "language"}\`).

## Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be reused. You can define a function using the \`function\` keyword or as an arrow function. For example:

\`\`\`javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
\`\`\`

## Control Structures
JavaScript provides various control structures to manage the flow of your code, such as:
- **If-Else Statements**: Used for conditional execution.
\`\`\`javascript
if (x > y) {
    console.log("x is greater than y");
} else {
    console.log("x is not greater than y");
}
\`\`\`
- **Loops**: Used for repeated execution of code blocks.
\`\`\`javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion
These are just a few of the basics of JavaScript that you'll need to know to work with Zen. As you progress through the tutorial, you'll learn more about how to use JavaScript effectively in your musical creations. Happy coding!
