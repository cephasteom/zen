# Zen-3

This project was built with, amongst other things, SvelteKit.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Docs
We use TSDocs to generate documentation for all Zen classes and synths. These generate each time you run a build. If you want to refresh them manually see the scripts in `package.json`.

## Hot Keys
* `cmd` + `s`: save. Brings up the save modal
* `cmd` + `o`: load. Brings up the load modal
